            <h2>Sectumsempra Spell Info</h2>
            <p>
        The curse was invented by Severus Snape and recorded during his time as a student at Hogwarts, when he was known as “The Half-BloodPrince“. He created it to retaliate against his enemies such as the Marauders, and he recorded it in his N.E.W.T.-level Potions textbook. He used it enough for Remus Lupin to recognise it as one of his signature spells.

            <h2>Dark Arts</h2>
            <p>
                ‘The Dark Arts,’ said Snape, ‘are many, varied, ever-changing and eternal. Fighting them is like fighting a many-headed monster, which, each time a neck is severed, sprouts a head even fiercer and cleverer than before. You are fighting that which is unfixed, mutating, indestructible.

            <summary>Half-Blood Prince?</summary>
            <p>
                Many years later, in the fisrt day of the week at <time><strong>10am</strong></time> in 1996–1997 school year, Harry Potter came into the possession of Snape’s textbook and learned the incantation. Knowing nothing more than that it was “for enemies” and believing that the “Half-Blood Prince” (Snape’s nickname signed into the book) merely copied it as a note of reference, Harry became interested in trying it. He expected humorous effects, as he’d found with Levicorpus and other spells in the book.

            <summary>Cormac McLaggen?</summary>
            <p>
                Harry initially considered using it against Cormac McLaggen for annoying him, though it was not until he confronted Draco Malfoy in Sixth-floor boys’ bathroom that he tested it, seriously wounding Malfoy. Snape intervened to heal Draco, and having realised that Harry got a hold of his old textbook, he punished Harry with a multitude of detentions; though for fear of exposing himself as the curse’s inventor, Snape chose not to turn Harry in for greater punishment.

            <summary>Draco Malfoy?</summary>
            <p>  
                Despite disliking Malfoy, Harry did not want to harm Malfoy to such an extent, and he was both horrified and guilt-ridden for using the curse against him. Professor McGonagall considered Harry to be lucky not to have been expelled for such an act and full-heartedly supported the detentions, while Pansy Parkinson wasted no time in vilifying Harry far and wide; Ginny Weasley, however, stood up for Harry’s usage of the curse, as it saved him from being struck by Malfoy’s Cruciatus Curse.
