                                 Awards
                                 <p>Nine years ago we set out to create a unique series of awards. We wanted to impartially identify the very best in the business, judged by experts who could draw on real-life experiences to inform their vote. These experts had to be people with unrivalled knowledge and passion for travel and food. They had to be people like you. Unlike other industry awards, ours are entirely nominated and voted on by <em>Food and Travel</em> readers.</p>
                                 <p>The 2020 nominations round has now closed. The shortlist will shortly be revealed in our October issue. Check back later to vote for your favourites and crown your winner who will take home a coveted trophy at our gala event on<strong> 14 December</strong>. You must be registered and logged in to vote in the 2020 awards.</p>
